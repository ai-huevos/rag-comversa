- Knowledge graph with 1,743 consolidated entities across 3 companies
- RAG system under development (PostgreSQL + pgvector + Neo4j)
- Cost: ~$500-1,000/month in OpenAI API costs

**His Challenge:**
"I want to challenge my own model, I now have the data"

**Session Goals:**
1. Challenge assumptions from original proposal using real extracted intelligence
