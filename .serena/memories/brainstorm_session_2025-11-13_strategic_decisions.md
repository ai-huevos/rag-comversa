# Strategic Brainstorming Session - November 13, 2025

## Core Strategic Decisions

### Business Model: Hybrid (Product + Services)
- **Tier 1**: Self-service platform (future state)
- **Tier 2**: Guided intelligence with consulting (current sweet spot - $799/month)
- **Tier 3**: Build-from-scratch premium (selective high-value - $10-30K)

### Current State: "Build While Flying"
- Deliver maximum automations, processes, and agents for Comversa (next 14 days)
- Use current project to fund platform development
- Goal: Software that scales infinitely (future state, not current)

### Target Customers
- **Primary**: B2B Companies (Los Tajibos, Comversa types)
- **Secondary**: Investors/PE Firms (M&A due diligence, portfolio optimization)

## 12 Priority Features (Selected from 28)

1. Auto-BPMN Generator
2. AI Interview Conductor
3. Automation Marketplace
5. Integration Hub
8. Agent Orchestrator
10. Role-Specific Dashboards
16. Confidence Tuning
19. Training Needs Analysis
20. Competitive Intelligence
21. No-Code Automation Builder
22. One-Click Agents
26. Start with Quick Wins
28. Outcome-Based Packaging

## Key Metrics Validated (Dashboard Screenshot)
- **276 pain points** extracted across companies
- **98 automations** identified with ROI calculations
- **$157K annual savings** identified
- **423% ROI** in Year 1 (vs $30K implementation cost)
- **85% confidence** in extracted intelligence
- **12% consolidation rate**, **8% contradiction rate**

## Strategic Breakthroughs

1. **You Built More Value Than You Sold**: Intelligence platform worth 10x+ the $37K consulting package
2. **Product vs. Consulting Clarity**: Extraction system IS the product, consulting is customer acquisition
3. **Comversa IS The Beta Customer**: Every deliverable = product template + sales collateral
4. **Quality Validation = Foundation**: Must validate extraction quality before scaling

## 90-Day Execution Roadmap

### Month 1 (Current): Finish Comversa Strong
- 60% through Phase 1, 14 days remaining
- Deploy all 22 Quick Wins ($5K-15K value each)
- Document everything for replication
- Generate case study with before/after metrics

### Month 2: Build Self-Service Onboarding
- Sales pitch deck with validated metrics
- 3-tier pricing finalized
- Onboarding flow for Tier 1 & 2
- Identify 10 target customers

### Month 3: Launch & Beta
- Launch 2 pricing tiers
- Find 3 beta customers
- Begin recurring revenue stream

## Bottlenecks Identified
1. **Time**: Solo developer needs leverage (solution: productize)
2. **Technical**: RAG validation needed before scaling (solution: weekend testing)
3. **Sales**: Need pitch deck + pricing (solution: Month 2 deliverables)

## Value Chain Discovered
BPMN → Automations → Agents → Multi-agent workflows (acting like organigram)
